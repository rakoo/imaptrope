This version of ximapd is based on https://github.com/shugo/ximapd and adapted to work
with heliotrope, the fabulous mail store by William Morgan : 
https://github.com/wmorgan/heliotrope

It is an IMAP server, supposed to offer an interface to the
JSON-over-HTTP interface of Heliotrope.

INSTALL, SETUP AND THE BORING THINGS

Read README.en (or.ja); you don't need to really install it to test it.
Just run 
$ ruby install.rb --prefix=./fake
to create the 'ximapd' bin that you will use afterwards. You can then
remove the ./fake dir safely.

USAGE

$ ruby -Iruby -Ibackends -I/path/to/heliotrope-client ximapd --start --debug

WHAT WORKS FOR NOW

NOTE : When I say it works, I don't mean it's totally safe. Use at your
own risks.
